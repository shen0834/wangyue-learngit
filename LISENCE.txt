What are GitHub's SSH key fingerprints?

Public key fingerprints can be used to validate a connection to a remote server.

GitHub's public key fingerprints, in hexadecimal, format are:

    16:27:ac:a5:76:28:2d:36:63:1b:56:4d:eb:df:a6:48 (RSA)
    ad:1c:08:a4:40:e3:6f:9c:f5:66:26:5d:4b:33:5d:8c (DSA)

GitHub also uses SSHFP DNS records to securely publish our SSH key fingerprints. You can query for our SSHFP records using the command below:

dig SSHFP github.com +nostats +nocomments +nocmd
# ;github.com.            IN  SSHFP
# github.com.     300 IN  SSHFP   2 1 7491973E5F8B39D5327CD4E08BC81B05F7710B49
# github.com.     300 IN  SSHFP   1 1 BF6B6825D2977C511A475BBEFB88AAD54A92AC73

Resolving issues when verifying fingerprints

If you try to automatically verify your fingerprint with ssh and the "VerifyHostKeyDNS yes" configuration, you may still receive a prompt to verify the key. For example:

ssh -T -o "VerifyHostKeyDNS yes" git@github.com
# The authenticity of host 'github.com (192.30.252.129)' can't be established.
# RSA key fingerprint is 16:27:ac:a5:76:28:2d:36:63:1b:56:4d:eb:df:a6:48.
# Matching host key fingerprint found in DNS.
# Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?

"VerifyHostKeyDNS yes" is supposed to prevent this prompt, but only if the fingerprints are retrieved from a zone signed with DNSSEC. We haven't added DNSSEC to our infrastructure yet, but it's in the roadmap.

You can find more about this in the debug output of the same command:

# debug1: Server host key: RSA 16:27:ac:a5:76:28:2d:36:63:1b:56:4d:eb:df:a6:48
# debug3: verify_host_key_dns
# debug1: found 2 insecure fingerprints in DNS
# debug1: matching host key fingerprint found in DNS

If you're curious, there are some more details about this behavior on the ssh_config(5) man page.

On OS X, you may also see an error about "No matching host key fingerprint found in DNS." For example:

ssh -T -o "VerifyHostKeyDNS ask" git@github.com
# The authenticity of host 'github.com (192.30.252.130)' can't be established.
# RSA key fingerprint is 16:27:ac:a5:76:28:2d:36:63:1b:56:4d:eb:df:a6:48.
# No matching host key fingerprint found in DNS.
# Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
# Warning: Permanently added 'github.com,192.30.252.130' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
# Hi jnewland! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

The resolver on OS X doesn't properly implement DNSSEC, so when openssh tries to look up the fingerprint in DNS, it fails. You can see this in the verbose output of the same SSH command:

# debug1: Server host key: RSA 16:27:ac:a5:76:28:2d:36:63:1b:56:4d:eb:df:a6:48
# debug3: verify_host_key_dns
# DNS lookup error: general failure
